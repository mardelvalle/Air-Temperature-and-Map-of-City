## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, APIs, JavaScript, Jquery

The api taken for air quality pulls the information from the two input fields to determine the air quality. At the same time, this data is turned into latitude and longitude coordinates. These coordinates are then put into the weather api and the google maps api to give back values.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a good chance to see that some apis require information to be in the html file as well as in the Javascript. It was also an oprutnity to combine several other apis that I have worked on into one to get a more meaningful application.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
